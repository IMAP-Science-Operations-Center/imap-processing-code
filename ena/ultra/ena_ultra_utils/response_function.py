def response_function(theta_angle,phi, energe):
    """
    function of the sensitive area for the given
    direction in the FOV, with energy dependence. The Response Function includes the Geometric
    Factor, and energy dependent transmission efficiencies.

    Note: 𝜃 and 𝜙 in this section reference angles in the IMAP-Ultra instrument frame and are not to
    be confused with 𝜃! and 𝜙! described later in the Despun Pointing Set Coordinate System.
