Processed Housekeeping data is used as input to badtimes list. It's not used for anything else at the moment. It could be used to confirm information in instrument status summary.

with every direct events, we annotate:
    1. Look direction in the sky(This is done by taking spin angle and then convert it into look direction in the sky. We can also convert it to spin phase). 
    2. Note coincidence events, whether it is single, double, triple or quad coincidence.
    3. Note ESA step information
