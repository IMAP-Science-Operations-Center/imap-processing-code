KPL/SCLK
 
SCLK Kernel for JPSS-3
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   This SCLK kernel contains the data necessary for converting from
   ephemeris time (ET) to JPSS-3 spacecraft clock ticks in the format,
   day:ms:us since Jan 1, 1958.

   DATA_TYPE means we use SCLK01 type (the only type?)
   TIME_SYSTEM is the time system to which SCLK times are
       converted before being converted to ET. 1 means TDB, 2 means TDT
   N_FIELDS is the number of fields in the SCLK string (3)
   MODULI refers to the max value of each field + 1
   OFFSETS Not sure I understand these. Think they should always be 0
   OUTPUT_DELIM I like ':' characters (2)
   PARTITION_XX boundaries. Given in ticks (usec in this case)
   COEFFICIENTS Each entry is (sclk value, corresponding parallel time value, rate)
       Since we assume JPSS seconds are "perfect", rate should always be 1.0
       We only have one partition currently
